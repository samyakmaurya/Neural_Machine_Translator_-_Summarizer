# Neural Machine Translator & Summarizer

This project aims to build a News
Translator and Summarizer using Neural
Machine Translations which uses a sequence to
sequence model which works on the encoder
decoder architecture to translate news articles
from Hindi to English.TF-IDF is used to
summarize the translated text which makes
it convenient for the reader to skim through
articles.Further we have used gTTs a python
library to convert the summarized text into
Speech. Results obtained by the extractive
summarizer were up to the mark and that of the
machine translator can use more improvement.
